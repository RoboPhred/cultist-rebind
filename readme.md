# Cultist Rebind

This is a mod for Cultist Simulator that lets you rebind all hotkeys.

Previously, Cultist Simulator allowed you to rebind some keys in the launch screen. However, this feature was removed.

This mod re-adds binding capability, as well as expanding it to controls previously not exposed for rebinding.

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/RoboPhred/cultist-rebind/releases/).

## Usage

With the mod installed, run the game once. This will create the configuration file.

The configuration file is located at `Cultist Simulator/BepInEx/config/CultistRebind.ini`.
Open this INI file in any text editor to see the available bindings. The config file accepts any KeyCode value. A list of values can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html).

## Installation

This mod uses BepInEx 5.2.

- Install [version 5.2](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.2) or later by extracting the zip file into your Cultist Simulator install location
- Run the game once, to let BepInEx create its folder structure.
- Place the cultist-rebind.dll file from the download into `Cultist Simulator/BepInEx/Plugins`

### Troubleshooting

If the mod isn't working, you can turn on the BepInEx logs to see what is going on.

Open your BepInEx config file at `Cultist Simulator/BepInEx/config/BepInEx.cfg` and enable the console by changing the `Enabled` key of `[Logging.Console]` to `true`.

```
[Logging.Console]
Enabled = true
```

Doing this will create a terminal window when you launch cultist simulator. If you do not see this new window open, then BepInEx is probably not installed correctly,
or the config file is misconfigured.

Once you get the window, check its output after you hit the play button on the Cultist Simulator launcher. You can either drag the terminal window to another
monitor, or tab out of Cultist Simulator to check it after launch.

If BepInEx is installed and configured properly, you should see messages similar to the following:

```
[Message:   BepInEx] BepInEx 5.0.0.0 RC1 - cultistsimulator
[Message:   BepInEx] Compiled in Unity v2018 mode
[Info   :   BepInEx] Running under Unity v2019.1.0.2698131
[Message:   BepInEx] Preloader started
[Info   :   BepInEx] 1 patcher plugin(s) loaded
[Info   :   BepInEx] Patching [UnityEngine.CoreModule] with [BepInEx.Chainloader]
[Message:   BepInEx] Preloader finished
```

Once you have confirmed BepInEx is installed properly, look for the mod loading message. Once you start the game from the launcher, the terminal window should contain:

```
[Info   :   BepInEx] Loading [CultistRecipeHotkeys 0.0.1]
```

and

```
[Info   :CultistRecipeHotkeys] CultistRecipeHotkeys initialized.
```

If you do not see these lines, then the mod isn't in the correct folder. Check the Installation instructions for details on where to put the mod.

If you have confirmed all of the above and still are having trouble, try looking at the terminal for lines starting with `[Error :CultistRecipeHotkeys]`. The mod will
try to log errors when it cannot do it's job properly. Create a github issue with any CultistRecipeHotkeys error messages you find, and I will try to help you further.
